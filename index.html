                    "This is probably one of my favorite group costumes because
                    we all got really into creating these characters. Some of us
                    put a lot more work into it than others, but they all 
                    turned out great."

                    "My friend who is the genius with paper mache helped me a lot
                    on this one. It takes a lot of time to create these heads, 
                    but the end result is great. The one thing that I didn't like
                    about this costume was how hard it was to hear or be heard. I 
                    ended taking the head off a lot throughout the night just so 
                    I could have conversations. "

                    "We had a lot more people join in for this group costume because we 
                    all grew up watching Nickelodeon and had our favorite characters. I 
                    steered clear of the paper mache this time because I learned my lesson
                    with the previous year. I really thought mine turned out great but
                    people still didn't know who I was. I had Cynthia, I thought that was
                    a dead give away. Guess not."

                    "This was by far the largest turn out we had for the group costumes. I
                    didn't realize so many people were into comics, although I should have known
                    with all of the movies that are centered around them. I don't know them too 
                    well though so I had help coming up with who I was going as. I'm the Scarlet
                    Witch, in case others are also unfamiliar with Marvel."

                    "This was the group costumes theme for 2017. However I did a bad job of 
                    documenting this past year and didn't get a group photo. My friend's 
                    recently adopted a dog that looks a lot like the dog from Up. So they 
                    went with that movie. As soon as I heard that I thought squirrel! So I 
                    created a squirrel. It took a long time, but turned out great."
